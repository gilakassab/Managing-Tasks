The hash algoritm is md5 for both tasks.

You have found a passwd file containing salted passwords.
An unprotected configuration file has revealed a salt of 2793(just example).
The hashed password for the 'admin' user appears to be 7d5f4266cb346ef2c2d9bfc6c9a7574b
(just example, don't try it will not work), try to brute force this password. John can't do the job.
Don't really try to brute forse it, only describe how to change or change the code from par. 5
to make the job. You don,t reaaly need to run it or to take care of imports.
Submit the changed code or the description.

2) 40 points
Use the template from targil 5 par. 3.5 , pass it through notepad to avoid errors.
Read "How to.docx" to understand how to use it(it still CTF!) or use Goggle search.
Create a file with the correct data and crack the password by John.
Submut solution(user, cracked password, exersise number, like ctf5-1).

Choose one from below for each group.  

ctf5-1: salt: 3760 ; pass hash: OEgFykzxepn/T2DrP8iPA0 
ctf5-2: salt: 7654 ; pass hash: xM2yTJ6k1s0lQBMfKLryX1
ctf5-3: salt: 9734 ; pass hash: DKUhQ0.ZZMD81EKdXdunc/
ctf5-4: salt: 1763 ; pass hash: bjcCkK3RnS6.MLVKYS4Yb/
ctf5-5: salt: 2332 ; pass hash: nFgP4NFdYbx7GVIjLGSOQ0
